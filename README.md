  Here, you'll find a collection of various projects I've worked on during my academic journey, from coding assignments, small project ideas to hardwae projects with documantation, simulations and implementation.
Is a reflection of my interests, skills and dedication to learning. They are arranged from last to previous, wanting to evidentiate the latest projects that i made.

• Project 1: Positive Linear Voltage Regulator
  In today's world, technology has become omnipresent, and the creation of electronic circuits stands as a cornerstone. As engineers, when crafting a circuit, we must meticulously consider various aspects to achieve our desired goals, making 
  careful selection of each component. This project was one of the most challenging one I did. 
  It is essentially a voltage regulator, having also an overcurrent and overvoltage protection implemented using power transistors such that the circuit or any component will not suffer any damage.
  
  My work was split in a few steps:
  -The research part, where I learned about this type of circuits from book, that you will find in the references list
  -Hand calculus part, where I tried to compute the best component values for the specific requirements that were given, taking into consideration the worst case scenario, the components tolerance, the functioning temperature and other factors that may create issues
  and can lead to unregulated output.
  -The simulation part, made after the previous part was done, where I verified the functionality of the circuit, it's behaviour for various input voltages and plotted the characteristics, in order to interpret them. For each simulation there is also an explanation of 
  how it was done and what parameters were imposed.
  -Physical implementation: This part is still in progress so I'm gonna give an update of project when it's finished.

• Project 2: Data Structures Algorithms Mini-project
  The Electronic Components Store (ElectroList) was my idea of semester project for the DSA. It is a simple C code. It uses a doubly linked list structure to store and organize details about each component, including the name, ID, and minimum quantity that can be purchased. When you run the program, a menu in the console is displayed and you can choose from the options given what are you looking for, facilitating simple and efficient inventory management.  
  
• Project 3: Glass Filling Project
  This is a project made in the first year of faculty for Applied Informatics and it is an Arduino type. The project consists of creating a system that will be able to fill a glass with water, using a distance sensor and a button. In its implementation, we will find 
  an ESP32 development board. It has only a romanian version of the project for now.
  
• Project 4: Library Management System
  I made this project in C++, for the Object Oriented Programming semester project and it is designed to store information regarding the institution, customers and its books. Each customer can perform a few actions such as add a new book or return books. Fore more 
  informations see the documentation.
